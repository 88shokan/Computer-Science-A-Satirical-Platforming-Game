#Purpose of this game is suppose to be really stupid,satirical and simple, but addicting somewhat.

#The obstacles and background music were made by me, with the obstacles being made on photoshop and pixelized, and the song being made on FL Studio 20

#The background, floor, and character model were not made by and were free resources

#Hardest part of making this game was definetly animating the player and obstacles, but my favorite part was making the song, as I enjoy art and music, so I am happy I got to implement my music onto this project!
